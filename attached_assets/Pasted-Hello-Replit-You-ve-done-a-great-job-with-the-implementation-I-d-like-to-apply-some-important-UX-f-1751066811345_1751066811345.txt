Hello Replit! You’ve done a great job with the implementation. I’d like to apply some important UX fixes and visual improvements. Please follow this full specification:

🔄 1. Add Page Transition Loading Animation

Implement a loading screen animation that appears when navigating between subpages.

It should show a centered animated red circular loader (e.g., CSS spinner or SVG-based).

The animation appears on link click, stays visible for ~0.5–1s, then disappears when the page finishes loading.

Ensure it's smooth and doesn’t disrupt scroll position or layout.

Example: fade-in red spinner with opacity animation.

🎨 2. Restore Box Layout for “Tournament Information” Section

Currently, the tournament info boxes (Date, Location, Contact, Email) look like the “Tournament Highlights” layout, which makes them visually repetitive.

Please restore the boxed layout from the older prototype, which had shadows, white backgrounds, padding, and rounded corners around each info block.

See uploaded screenshots for visual reference (older left design).

🎨 3. Invitations Page – Bring Back Box Layout

On invitations.html, reinstate the box-like card design around:

The invitation content block

The registration grid (Required Documents, Important Dates, etc.)

The contact section

Use similar styling from the info.html page’s .content-card structure if needed.

It should be visually distinct from the background and grouped into clean cards.

🖱 4. Improve CTA Visibility: “Contact Us” Button

In the “Ready to Join the Competition?” section:

The “Contact Us” button currently has very low contrast unless hovered.

Increase its base visibility by adding a subtle border, light background, or inverted color (light red or neutral).

Ensure it visually matches the “View Invitations” button for uniformity.

✅ Goal: both buttons are visible and accessible at all times, even before hover.

🏠 5. Make EGCA Logo Clickable

In the top navbar, make the EGCA 2025 title/logo clickable and link it to the homepage (index.html).

Add cursor: pointer style and aria-label="Home" for accessibility.

The anchor is partially there in invitations.html and info.html:

html
Copy
Edit
<a href="index.html" aria-label="EGCA European 2025 Home">
Confirm that this is styled consistently across all pages.

💠 6. Keep All Microanimations

Keep all smooth transitions and hover effects currently in place.

Ensure animations are subtle (e.g., 200–300ms) and do not interfere with readability or user flow.

Microanimations should apply to:

Navigation links

Button hovers

Form focus states

Scroll-to-top button

✅ These are already working well — just preserve them while applying other changes.
