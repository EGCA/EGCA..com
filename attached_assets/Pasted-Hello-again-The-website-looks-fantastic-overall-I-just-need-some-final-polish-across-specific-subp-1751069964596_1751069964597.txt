Hello again! The website looks fantastic overall. I just need some final polish across specific subpages to align the design with our original intent. Please make the following adjustments grouped by page:

🧭 GLOBAL ADJUSTMENTS
Box Component Consistency

Wherever appropriate, please use the same card/box format already implemented in the “Official Tournament Invitation” section on the Invitations page.

This style includes:

Light background

Rounded corners

Box shadow

Consistent padding

Top border accent (colored line)

1. Box Design for “Our Mission” & “What is Goalball?”
These sections should use the same box/card design as “Official Tournament Invitation”.

This keeps the site’s aesthetic consistent and avoids flat sections on an otherwise clean layout.

2. “Get in Touch” Section – Remove “Call Now” Button
The “Call Now” button under the Phone section is invisible unless hovered and redundant. Please remove this button entirely.

3. Restore Original Format for “Official Tournament Invitation”
Please bring back the old version’s structure:

A main white box with the “EGCA European 2025 Goalball Tournament” title.

Contact block (with email/organizer details) styled as a nested card within the main box.

Align this style with the screenshots of the old left-side version provided.

4. “Contact for Registration” Button Visibility
This button blends into the white background—apply a visible button style similar to the “Apply to Volunteer” or “Print Invitation” buttons.

Recommended: outline style or light-filled style with dark text on hover.

5. Volunteer Support Services Section
Convert the full text block (with categories like Information & Guidance, Competition Support, etc.) into a group of 3–4 styled boxes using the “Official Tournament Invitation” design.

Example box per category:

Title + bullet list inside a card.

6. Make “Become a Partner” Button Visible
Like the registration button above, this CTA blends in with the background.

Apply visible styling: e.g., light red background, border, or outline.

7. Contact Information Section
Convert it into a styled box, matching the card style of “Official Tournament Invitation”.

8. Contact Form “Clear Form” Button
This button is nearly invisible until hovered.

Fix it to match the styling of the “Send Message” button (contrast visible at all times).

9. “About This Website” Section – Full Redesign
This section is currently broken/glitched visually.

Please remake it as a set of cards/boxes (one for each info category):

Accessibility Commitment

Technical Info

Browser Support

Mobile Experience

Use the consistent card design across all with icons and descriptive content inside.

Reference the clean layout from “Official Tournament Invitation” and apply similar spacing and balance.

✅ Final Touches
Ensure all buttons are fully visible without hover.

Maintain all previously added microanimations and smooth transitions.

Keep the dark mode toggle working properly.

Let me know once these fixes are live and I’ll be happy to give a final pass. You’re doing amazing work!
