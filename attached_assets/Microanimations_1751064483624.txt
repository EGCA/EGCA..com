Please enhance the user interface with subtle, modern microanimations using CSS or lightweight JavaScript. Here are the animation requests:

Element	Animation
Buttons	Smooth hover effect (scale up + color change)
Team cards	Slight elevation (box-shadow) on hover
Hero section text	fadeIn on page load
Section transitions	fadeUp when scrolling into view (use IntersectionObserver if needed)
Navigation link hover	Underline slide-in animation
Dark mode toggle switch	Smooth transition on toggle
Form inputs/buttons	Focused border glow or background transition

Use transition: all 0.3s ease; as a base where appropriate. Animations should be lightweight, not overdone, and compatible with mobile.
