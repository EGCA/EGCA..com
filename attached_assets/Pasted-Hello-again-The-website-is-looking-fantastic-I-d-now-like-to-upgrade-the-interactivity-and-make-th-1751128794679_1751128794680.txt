Hello again! The website is looking fantastic. I’d now like to upgrade the interactivity and make the design even more dynamic and user-friendly. Please implement the following three feature enhancements, each with detailed specifications.

🌐 1. Add a Language Switcher Button (i18n)
Goal:
Allow users to select a different European language, and auto-translate all website content accordingly.

Implementation Details:
Location: Place this button next to the existing dark/light mode toggle in the top-right corner of the header.

Design:

The button should be identical in shape/style to the dark/light toggle.

It should feature a globe icon 🌐 or EU flag 🇪🇺 by default.

On Click:

A dropdown or pop-out menu should appear, listing multiple European languages:

English 🇬🇧 (default), Greek 🇬🇷, French 🇫🇷, German 🇩🇪, Italian 🇮🇹, Spanish 🇪🇸, Polish 🇵🇱, Dutch 🇳🇱

When a language is selected, all site text should dynamically update (including nav, headers, paragraphs, buttons, etc.)

Optional Tech: If helpful, you may use a simple JSON-based solution or static translations per language. No need for full Google Translate API unless already implemented.

🗳️ 2. Add a Voting System in results.html
Goal:
Enable users to vote for the team they believe will win, and display a live chart of top 5 teams based on votes.

Section Placement:
Below the match results content in results.html.

Visual Layout:
Top of Section: A dynamic bar or donut chart that displays the top 5 voted teams and their current percentage of votes.

Below the Chart:

A dropdown menu or set of team cards/buttons allowing users to vote for their preferred team.

After submitting, the user:

Gets a confirmation message (“Thanks for voting!”)

Can no longer vote again (use localStorage or cookie to store this).

Sees the chart update with their vote.

Logic:
Each user can only vote once per session/browser.

Voting data can be stored either in local variables, browser storage (for mockup), or temporarily in-memory.

Teams available to vote should match those on the actual Teams subpage.

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 3. Add Team Popups in teams.html
Goal:
When users click on a team card, a modal popup should display with:

Full player roster (names, roles)

Coach/staff info

Optional: flag of the country, team logo, or group position

Behavior:
Clicking on a team triggers a modal (styled consistently with the rest of the site).

The modal should include:

A header with the team name + flag

A section for Players: Name, position (optional: image placeholder)

A section for Coach / Staff: Name(s), role

A close button or click-outside-to-close option

Suggested Enhancements:
Use smooth microanimations for the popup.

Make sure it’s mobile-friendly (responsive layout).

✅ Final Notes:
Ensure all new components maintain:

Dark/light mode compatibility

Visual consistency with existing styles

Smooth transitions and animations

If needed, feel free to use vanilla JS, localStorage, or lightweight libraries for charting (e.g., Chart.js).

Once done, I’d love a quick summary of what was implemented and how you structured the translations, voting logic, and modals.

Thank you!
