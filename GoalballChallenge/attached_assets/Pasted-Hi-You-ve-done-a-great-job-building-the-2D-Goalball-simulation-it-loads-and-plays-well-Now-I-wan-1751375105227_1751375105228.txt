Hi! You've done a great job building the 2D Goalball simulation — it loads and plays well. Now I want to enhance realism, suspense, and visual feedback for key interactions. Here's what I need you to improve:

🎯 Objective
Make the ball movement, goal scoring, and blocking more visually and mechanically realistic, to better reflect the intensity and precision of actual Goalball. Also, upgrade the court layout to resemble the official Goalball dimensions (in 2D) — as shown in the reference image I provided.

🛠 Specific Improvements Required
1. ⚽ Ball Mechanics – Realistic Shots
When a player serves or shoots, the ball should:

Travel toward open goal space, not directly at a defender

Have slight curvature or diagonal movement instead of snapping straight

Appear to roll/bounce slightly (small vertical oscillation)

Optionally include a trail effect (CSS or canvas-based) for realism

Optional enhancement:
Allow “power” or “accuracy” variance to create occasional misfires or critical shots.

2. 🧤 Blocking – Suspense and Logic Upgrade
Currently the ball just touches a defender — let’s make it more game-like:

Add block animations: glow, pulse, or flash if a defender blocks

Introduce a reaction time window or success chance, not instant reaction

Add a small "reach zone" radius per defender (not just perfect lane match)

Example: A defender in “Center” may still block a “slightly off-center” shot if close enough.

3. 🥅 Goal Area – Make It Bigger & Clearer
Extend the goal width to cover the full left-to-right range (like real Goalball)

Visually mark the goal zone at the top and bottom with:

Bold goal lines

Text: "GOAL ZONE" or "YOUR GOAL" / "BOT GOAL"

Optional: color change when ball enters goal

4. 🏟 Court Layout Redesign
Use the reference image I shared and:

Divide the court into:

Orientation area

Landing area

Neutral zone

Use dashed lines for guidance

Center circle for serve zone

Keep the design 2D but inspired by the 3D look

5. 🔊 Audio Feedback
Add sound when a goal is scored (whistle or crowd cheer)

Add sound for a block (deflection thump)

Optionally, add a “whoosh” sound when the ball is rolling fast

✅ Summary of What You Should Implement
Feature	Upgrade
Ball shooting	Add curve, bounce, and better lane targeting
Blocking	Add suspense, visuals, success logic, and small reaction radius
Goal system	Expand goal width, show goal area, add goal-scoring effect
Court layout	Match 2D version of official Goalball field (orientation/landing zones)
Audio cues	Add sounds for roll, block, goal

The goal is to make each serve feel like a moment of tension, where the ball might just miss or get blocked by milliseconds — like in real Goalball.

Let me know if you need JSON/canvas coordinates for goal area layout or physics formulas for bounces!
